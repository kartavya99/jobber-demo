# Jobber Web Application

### a complete ecommerce freelance marketplace from scratch using popular development tools and the microservices architectural patterns. this is a fullstack application that focuses on developing microservices and connecting them to a client web application because when building large scale applications intended for growth, microservices architecture is the go-to solution

- `Development of microservices and client applicatioin`
- `Deployment to kubernetes`
- `CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins`
- `Monitoring and logs management`
